# Perfectly Balanced - for Gods & Kings

Tired of those multiplayer opponents whining "Babylon OP game is trash"? Don't like the way they butchered your culture's proud history by generalizing it into several dumb uniques? You have come to the right place.

**This mod strips all unique elements away from every major nation**. No overpowered [uniques](./jsons/Nations.json), [buildings](./jsons/ModOptions.json), [units](./jsons/ModOptions.json) and [improvements](./jsons/TileImprovements.json), hence every civilization starts as equals. Download the mod and enjoy your perfectly balanced game, purely determined by your skills and wit! ...Plus an absurd amount of starting position luck.

* Version: 3.19.*
* Base Ruleset: Civ V - Gods & Kings

*Disclaimer: City states will still retain their uniques.*
